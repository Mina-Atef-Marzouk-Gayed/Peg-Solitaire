# Peg Solitaire Solver (C++)

A C++ implementation of the classic **Peg Solitaire** puzzle using a **recursive backtracking algorithm**. The goal is to remove pegs by jumping them over each other into empty holes, leaving a single peg—ideally in the center.

## How It Works

1. The board is a **7x7 grid** with pegs and an empty center.
2. The solver tries **all possible moves**: left, right, up, and down.
3. Moves are applied using `move()` and undone with `unmove()` if they don’t work.
4. The program keeps track of successful moves and prints them step by step.
5. Optional **interactive mode** pauses between moves for easier visualization.
